Other issues that I'd like to deal with eventually:
1. When user clicks "Save to Spotify" there is some indication that it's done, then the Playlist is cleared.
2. Find out why the first search does not return anything, but the second attempt, using the same search, does as expected
3. The <h3> for the track name is too big - trivial to fix the css
4. There must be a height issue in the css for the Track, tracks that have a lot of characters mess up the track list 
    - e.g. try "alice looking glass" as the search term!
